This sample shows how to use the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
realtime database to implement a simple Tic Tac Toe game on [Google App Engine
Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

## Setup

Make sure you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)
installed. You'll need this to test and deploy your App Engine app.

### Authentication

* Create a project in the [Firebase
  console](https://firebase.google.com/console)
* In the Overview section, click 'Add Firebase to your web app' and replace the
  contents of the file
  [`templates/_firebase_config.html`](templates/_firebase_config.html) with the
  given snippet. This provides credentials for the javascript client.
* For running the sample locally, you'll need to download a service account to
  provide credentials that would normally be provided automatically in the App
  Engine environment. Click the gear icon in the Firebase Console and select
  'Permissions'; then go to the 'Service accounts' tab. Download a new or
  existing App Engine service account credentials file. Then set the environment
  variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path to this file:

      export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json

  This allows the server to create unique secure tokens for each user for
  Firebase to validate.

### Install dependencies

Before running or deploying this application, install the dependencies using
[pip](http://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):

    pip install -t lib -r requirements.txt

## Running the sample

    dev_appserver.py .

For more information on running or deploying the sample, see the [App Engine
Standard README](../../README.md).
