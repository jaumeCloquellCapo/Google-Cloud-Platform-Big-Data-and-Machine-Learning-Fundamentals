"""Command-line sample app demonstrating customer-supplied encryption keys.

This sample demonstrates uploading an object while supplying an encryption key,
retrieving that object's contents, and finally rotating that key to a new
value.

This sample is used on this page:

    https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/json-api-python-samples

For more information, see the README.md under /storage.

# Although these keys are provided here for simplicity, please remember that it
