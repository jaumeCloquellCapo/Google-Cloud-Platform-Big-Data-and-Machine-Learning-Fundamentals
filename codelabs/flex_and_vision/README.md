This sample demonstrates how to use the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/), and [Google Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/) on [Google App Engine Flexible Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

## Setup

Create a new project with the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
Make a note of your project ID, which may be different than your project name.

Make sure to [Enable Billing](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/billing?debugUI=DEVELOPERS)
for your project.

Download the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/) to your
local machine. Alternatively, you could use the [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/quickstart), which comes with the Google Cloud SDK pre-installed.

Initialize the Google Cloud SDK (skip if using Cloud Shell):

    gcloud init

Create your App Engine application:

    gcloud app create

Set an environment variable for your project ID, replacing `[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]`
with your project ID:

    export PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

## Getting the sample code

Run the following command to clone the Github repository:

    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples.git

Change directory to the sample code location:

    cd python-docs-samples/codelabs/flex_and_vision

## Authentication

Enable the APIs:

    gcloud services enable vision.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable storage-component.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable datastore.googleapis.com

Create a Service Account to access the Google Cloud APIs when testing locally:

    gcloud iam service-accounts create hackathon \
    --display-name "My Hackathon Service Account"

Give your newly created Service Account appropriate permissions:

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
    --member serviceAccount:hackathon@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role roles/owner

After creating your Service Account, create a Service Account key:

    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/key.json --iam-account \
    hackathon@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com

Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to where
you just put your Service Account key:

    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/${USER}/key.json"

## Running locally

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    virtualenv -p python3 env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a Cloud Storage bucket. It is recommended that you name it the same as
your project ID:

    gsutil mb gs://${PROJECT_ID}

Set the environment variable `CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET`:

    export CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=${PROJECT_ID}

Start your application locally:

    python main.py

Visit `localhost:8080` to view your application running locally. Press `Control-C`
on your command line when you are finished.

When you are ready to leave your virtual environment:

    deactivate

## Deploying to App Engine

Open `app.yaml` and replace <your-cloud-storage-bucket> with the name of your
Cloud Storage bucket.

Deploy your application to App Engine using `gcloud`. Please note that this may
take several minutes.

    gcloud app deploy

Visit `https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot.com` to view your deployed application.
