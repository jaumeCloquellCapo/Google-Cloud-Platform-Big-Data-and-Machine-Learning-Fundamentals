This directory contains samples for Google Cloud Composer. `Google Cloud Composer`_ is a managed Apache Airflow service that helps you create, schedule, monitor and manage workflows. Cloud Composer automation helps you create Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow-native tools, such as the powerful Airflow web interface and command line tools, so you can focus on your workflows and not your infrastructure.
